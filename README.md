# AI Agents

108 specialized agents for OpenCode. Built through extensive research (Oparin n=600 evaluation, scientific literature on LLM prompting, A/B testing with 6 agent variants) and manual quality review of every agent file.

## Quick Start

1. **Copy files**: Put `.opencode/` folder into your OpenCode working directory
2. **Add instructions**: Copy `AGENTS.md` contents into your project's instruction file
3. **Done**: Agents are auto-discovered from `.opencode/agents/`. Invoke with `@agent-name`

## Design Philosophy

Each agent is crafted based on research-proven principles:

- **Domain checklists** over generic advice — specific failure patterns the model might miss
- **Decision tables** encoding when to choose what — prevents wrong technology/pattern choices
- **Anti-patterns** preventing known failures — directly addresses common precision problems
- **Knowledge activation triggers** — section headers that activate the model's latent expertise
- **No rigid output templates** — proven #1 score killer in evaluations
- **No adjective lists** — zero measured lift over bare model
- **Conservative enhancement** of domain knowledge — the winning approach in n=600 evaluation

## Sources & Methodology

Agents were built by analyzing multiple sources and selecting the best content from each:

- **Original v1 agents** — hand-crafted domain knowledge preserved where valuable
- **Improved versions** — decision tables, anti-patterns, and domain checklists added
- **Oparin agent research** (n=600 evaluation) — methodology and structure validated
- **External collections** (augmnt, affaan-m, others) — cross-checked for unique domain content
- **Scientific research** — U-shaped attention (Liu et al.), instruction scaling (Distyl AI), terminal reinforcement (Google Research)

Every agent was manually reviewed with full reads of all available sources. No automated batch processing.

## Features

- **108 Specialized Agents**: Development, DevOps, security, data science, ML/AI, architecture, business
- **Research-Optimized**: Structure validated against n=600 evaluation data
- **Decision Tables**: Every agent encodes when-to-choose-what guidance
- **Anti-Patterns**: Prevent known failure modes specific to each domain
- **Auto-Discovered**: OpenCode automatically discovers agents from `.opencode/agents/`
- **Zero Dependencies**: Pure markdown files with YAML frontmatter
