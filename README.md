# AI Agents

108 specialized AI agents for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai). Each agent is a domain expert — loaded on demand as a Markdown file, applied to the current task, then discarded. No subprocesses, no configuration, no dependencies.

## Why use it

Generic AI assistants produce mediocre results on specialized work. A domain-specific agent with checklists, anti-patterns, and decision tables produces measurably better output — validated in n=600 evaluations.

- **PostgreSQL migration?** Load `postgres-pro` — it knows indexing strategies, migration patterns, and when to use BRIN vs B-tree.
- **SwiftUI refactor?** Load `swift-pro` — it understands actor isolation, `@MainActor` rules, and iOS lifecycle pitfalls.
- **Security audit?** Load `security-reviewer` — OWASP Top 10, injection vectors, auth bypass patterns.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itohnobue/ai-agents-opencode
cp -R ai-agents-opencode/.opencode /path/to/your/project/
```

Agents in `.opencode/agents/` are auto-discovered by OpenCode. Browse `.opencode/agents/INDEX.md` for the full categorized directory.

## How agents are built

Structure validated against n=600 evaluations (Oparin research). Built through manual review of multiple agent collections, cross-checked for unique domain content. No automated batch processing. Pure Markdown with YAML frontmatter — zero dependencies.
