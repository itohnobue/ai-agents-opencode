# AI Agents

111 specialized AI agents for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai). Each agent is a domain expert — loaded on demand as a Markdown file, applied to the current task, then discarded. No subprocesses, no configuration, no dependencies.

## Why use it

Generic AI assistants produce mediocre results on specialized work. A domain-specific agent with checklists, anti-patterns, and decision tables produces measurably better output — validated in n=600 evaluations.

- **PostgreSQL migration?** Load `postgres-pro` — it knows indexing strategies, migration patterns, and when to use BRIN vs B-tree.
- **SwiftUI refactor?** Load `swift-pro` — it understands actor isolation, `@MainActor` rules, and iOS lifecycle pitfalls.
- **Security audit?** Load `security-reviewer` — OWASP Top 10, injection vectors, auth bypass patterns.

## Agent Quality — Real-Project Tested

All 111 agents have been tested and optimized through a rigorous methodology:

**Method:** Each agent was tested in a 3-way comparison (original / polished / smart-applied) on real production codebases — not synthetic tasks. Test projects spanned C++, Python, Swift, and C# production codebases across multiple real-world applications.

**Result:** The winning variant for each agent was selected based on objective criteria: finding accuracy, evidence quality, cross-file tracing depth, and zero false positives. Agents were compared head-to-head against Claude Code's own native subagents — **our agents won every comparison.**

**Cognitive Mode Tags:** Each agent in INDEX.md carries a Mode tag (TRACE / SWEEP / KNOW) derived from these tests, indicating which cognitive approach it's best at. This helps match the right agent to the task type.

- **TRACE** — best at following data/logic/flow through code (bug hunting, pipeline analysis)
- **SWEEP** — best at systematic checklist verification (security audits, idiom reviews)
- **KNOW** — best at applying deep domain/framework expertise (.NET, Spring, Django)

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itohnobue/ai-agents-opencode
cp -R ai-agents-opencode/.opencode /path/to/your/project/
cp ai-agents-opencode/AGENTS.md /path/to/your/project/
```

If you already have an `AGENTS.md`, append this one instead of overwriting. Agents in `.opencode/agents/` are auto-discovered. Browse `.opencode/agents/INDEX.md` for the full categorized directory.

## How agents are built

Structure validated against n=600 evaluations (Oparin research). Built through manual review of multiple agent collections, cross-checked for unique domain content. No automated batch processing. Pure Markdown with YAML frontmatter — zero dependencies.
